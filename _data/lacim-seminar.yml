    $q$-analogs of rational numbers: from Ostrowski numeration systems to perfect matchings
  date: 2025-11-28
  abstract: >
    We consider the $q$-deformation of rational numbers introduced recently by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. We propose three enumerative interpretations of these $q$-rationals: in terms of a new version of Ostrowski's numeration system for integers, in terms of order ideals of fence posets and in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Contrary to previous results which are restricted to rational numbers greater than one, our interpretations work for all positive rational numbers and are based on a single combinatorial object for defining both the numerator and denominator. The proofs rest on order-preserving bijections between posets over these objects. We recover a formula for a $q$-analog of Markoff numbers. We also deduce a fourth interpretation given in terms of the integer points inside a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^k$ on both sides of a hyperplane where $k$ is the length of the continued fraction expansion. This is joint work with Jean-Christophe Aval: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11290.

    Aldous-type spectral gaps in Unitary groups
  date: 2025-11-21
  abstract: >
    Around 1992, Aldous made the following bold conjecture. Let A be any set of transpositions in the symmetric group Sym(N). Then the spectral gap of the Cayley graph Cay(Sym(N),A) is identical to that of a relatively tiny N-vertex graph defined by A. So even though the spectrum of the Cayley graph contains N! eigenvalues, the largest non-trivial one always comes from a tiny pool of N of them. This conjecture was proven nearly 20 years later by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer (JAMS, 2010). 
    In a joint work with Gil Alon, driven by the conviction that such a stunning phenomenon cannot possibly be isolated, we found a probable parallel of this phenomenon in the unitary group U(N). We have a concrete conjecture supported by simulations, and we prove it in several non-trivial special cases. As it turns out, the corresponding spectrum in the case of U(N) contains the one in Sym(N). Moreover, the critical part of the spectrum in U(N) coincides with the spectrum of an interesting discrete process we call the "multiset process". 
    I will explain the original conjecture of Aldous, the new conjecture and our findings.

    Enumeration and structure of triangular and concave partitions
  date: 2025-11-14
  time: 13h30
  abstract: >
    A triangular partition is a partition whose Ferrers diagram can be separated from its complement (as a subset of $N^2$) by a straight line. These objects have appeared in earlier work by Onn and Sturmfels and by Corteel et al., and more recently by Bergeron and Mazin in the context of algebraic combinatorics. In this talk, we give a characterization of triangular partitions and the cells that can be added or removed while preserving the triangular condition, and use it to describe the Möbius function of the restriction of Young's lattice to triangular partitions. We obtain a formula for the number of triangular partitions whose Young diagram fits inside a square, deriving, as a byproduct, a new proof of Lipatov's enumeration theorem for balanced words. We also present an algorithm that efficiently generates all the triangular partitions of a given size. Finally, we discuss how these ideas extend to the broader setting of concave partitions, which have recently attracted attention for their connections to Schur-positivity conjectures.

    Méandres arc-en-ciel sur des chemins de Dyck

    Un méandre (de longueur n) est une paire de correspondances non-croisées sur {1,...,n}. 
    On peut le représenter sur le plan réel comme un paire d'ensembles de demi-cercles, qui ne s'intersectent pas deux à deux, reliant n points sur une droite. 
    Cette représentation géométrique permet d'introduire des notions de connexités qui se révèlent utiles dans plusieurs domaines : la théorie des nœuds, les algèbres de Lie, la combinatoire des mots et la théorie des représentations de carquois. 
    Dans ces domaines, nous nous focalisons généralement sur l'étude d'une sous-famille de méandres, dites arc-en-ciel, paramétrés par des paires de compositions de n.
    Dans cet exposé, nous allons introduire une nouvelle famille de méandres construits comme des méandres arc-en-ciel sur des chemins de Dyck, qui généralisera, d'une certaine manière, les méandres arc-en-ciel classiques. 
    Ces derniers sont inspirés de travaux récents menés en collaboration avec M. Lapointe, Y. Palu, P.-G. Plamondon, C. Reutenauer et H. Thomas.  
    Nous proposerons ensuite un algorithme, fondé sur des calculs arithmétiques, qui permettra de déterminer, par calcul, les caractéristiques géométriques d'un tel méandre.

    Generalized Cauchy determinants
  date: 2025-10-30
  abstract: >
    To any power series $G(z)$ we can associate a multivariate power series defined by $G_N(z,a_1,\dots,a_N,b_1,\dots,B_N) = \frac{\det[G(za_ib_j)]}{\Delta(za_1,\dots,za_N)\Delta(b_1,\dots,b_N)},$ where $\Delta$ is the Vandermonde polynomial and the denominator of $G_N$ divides its numerator because the determinant is an alternating function of its rows and columns. 
    We call $G_N$ the Cauchy determinant with generating function $G$. 
    Indeed, when $G$ is the geometric series the classical Cauchy identity evaluates $G_N$ explicitly. 
    This lecture is about what happens when $G$ is something more general than the geometric series, for example a hypergeometric function. 
    We will see that hypergeometric Cauchy determinants have many remarkable features, including connections with Hurwitz theory and quasimodular forms.

    Enumerating Posets through Incidence matrices

    Partially ordered sets (posets) have long served as fundamental
    combinatorial structures connecting order theory, lattice theory, and
    algebraic combinatorics. In this talk, we will present a matrix-based
    framework for studying and enumerating finite posets through their

    into a (0,1)-matrix representation, we obtain an algebraic and algorithmic
    approach to the classification and enumeration of posets up to isomorphism.
    This perspective allows us to reformulate several classical enumeration
    problems in poset theory. This talk will also include recent results on
    enumeration as well as applications to operad structures.

    $c$-Birkhoff polytopes
  date: 2025-10-10
  abstract: >
    In 2017, Davis and Sagan found that a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff subpolytope and an order polytope have the same normalized volume. 
    They ask whether the two polytopes are unimodularly equivalent. 
    We give an affirmative answer to a generalization of this question. 
    For each Coxeter element $c$ in the symmetric group, we define a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff subpolytope, which we call the $c$-Birkhoff polytope, 
    and an order polytope of the heap poset of the $c$-sorting word of the longest permutation.
    We show the two polytopes are unimodularly equivalent. 
    As a consequence, we show the normalized volume of the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is equal to the number of the longest chains in a corresponding Cambrian lattice. 
    In particular, when $c$ = $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{n-1}$, this resolves the question by Davis and Sagan.

    Maximal transitivity of the cactus group on standard Young tableaux
  date: 2025-09-19
  time: 13h00
  abstract: >
    (Joint work with Sophia Liao)
    The action of the cactus group on Young tableaux of a given shape goes back
    to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal
    bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is
    2-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $\lambda$ if and only
    if $\lambda$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show
    that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group
    of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the
    alternating group. As an application, this implies that the Galois group of
    solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group
    $GL_n$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends
    the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois
    group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.

    Harmonic functions on filtered and shifted Young graphs
  date: 2025-08-29
  abstract: >
    We consider the convex set of harmonic functions on the Young lattice and some related graphs. One can precisely describe the boundary of this set by understanding the Schur positive specializations of the algebra of symmetric functions, which in turn are completely parametrized by the Edrei-Thoma theorem. Yeliussizov solved the analogous classification problem for the filtered Young lattice by studying Grothendieck positive specializations. This talk will explain these results and discuss their shifted variants. In the filtered shifted case, achieving the desired classification requires us to use a general Chevalley formula in equivariant K-theory due to Lenart-Postnikov to prove a positivity property of K-Stanley symmetric functions for signed permutations.

    Order-theoretic Semantics for Recursive Session-Typed Processes
  date: 2025-05-16

    Session-typed programming languages help programmers correctly implement
    communicating systems. Though many techniques exist for reasoning about
    these languages and their processes, few treat general recursive types and
    few are compositional. As a consequence, they cannot be applied to many
    useful programs and they do not support modular reasoning. In this talk, I
    will present a denotational semantics for Polarized Intuitionistic Processes
    (PIP), a session-typed proofs-as-processes interpretation of polarized
    intuitionistic linear logic. PIP features general recursion, channel
    transmission, choices, and synchronization. This semantics generalizes
    Kahn’s semantics for dataflow networks to support bidirectional,
    session-typed communication. It supports modular reasoning and validates
    expected program equivalences. Moreover, it is sound relative to barbed
    congruence (the canonical behavioural notion of process equivalence), and it
    is fully abstract in the absence of negative channel transmission. As a
    result, our semantics provides an intuitively reasonable account of
    session-typed communication and a foundation for reasoning about processes
    in more realistic session-typed languages.

     A Local Algorithm for Coplactic Switching of Young Tableaux
  date: 2025-05-09

    Tableau coswitching is a bijection on pairs of skew Young tableaux which
    swaps their relative positions. This function was originally defined by
    David Speyer to describe the monodromy of certain smooth covers of the
    moduli space M_{0,r}-bar. Coswitching is defined by first performing JDT
    rectification on the union of the tableaux, switching the resulting pair,
    then unrectifying the union. This definition requires us to perform
    large-scale modifications to the skew shapes during the rectification and
    unrectification steps, which is both computationally taxing and obscures the
    effect of coswitching on the pair of skew tableaux. In this talk, we will
    present an algorithm which computes coswitching as a sequence of local
    steps, meaning we do not alter the skew shapes during the computation. We
    also highlight a connection between this algorithm and the Schützenberger
    involution, a fundamental operation on Young tableaux with applications in
    representation theory.

    Thick subcategories and g-finiteness in the category of projective

  abstract: >
    The category of projective presentations, or 2-term complexes, behaves in
    many ways as a mirror of the category of finite-dimensional modules over a
    finite-dimensional algebra. Both satisfy similar properties, however, unlike
    the category of modules, the category of projective presentations is not
    abelian, but rather an extriangulated category. In this talk, we reinforce
    the relation between these two categories by establishing an analogue of the
    Ingalls-Thomas correspondences within the category of projective
    presentations. We will exhibit bijections between the sets of isomorphism
    classes of 2-term silting objects, complete cotorsion pairs, and thick
    subcategories with enough injectives of the category of projective
    presentations. Furthermore, we will show how these correspondences mirror
    those between the sets of isomorphism classes of support tau-tilting pairs,
    functorially finite torsion classes, and left wide subcategories of the
    module category.

    Additionally, we introduce new equivalent conditions for an algebra to be
    g-finite. Namely, we show that an algebra has finitely many isomorphism
    classes of silting objects if and only if all cotorsion pairs are complete,
    and if and only if there are finitely many thick subcategories of projective
    presentations. We will establish that in such cases, all thick subcategories
    have enough injectives.

    The totally positive flag variety of rank r, defined by Lusztig, can be

    flag varieties of consecutive rank, this equals the subset of the flag
    variety with positive Plücker coordinates, yielding a straightforward
    condition to determine whether a flag is totally positive. This generalizes
    the well-established fact, proven independently by many authors including
    Rietsch, Talaska and Williams, Lam, and Lusztig, that the totally positive
    Grassmannian equals the subset of the Grassmannian with positive Plücker
    coordinates. While this result is algebro-geometric in nature, we will also

    RSK as a linear operator
  date: 2025-02-21
  time: 15h
  abstract: >
    The Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence (RSK) is a bijection of central
    importance in algebraic combinatorics, mapping nonnegative integer matrices
    to pairs $(P, Q)$ of semistandard Young tableaux. This set-theoretic
    bijection extends to define a linear operator on the coordinate ring of the
    space ${\sf Mat}_{m, n}$ of $m\times n$ matrices. The linear operator
    properties of RSK have received little study, despite the usefulness of this
    operator in several classical applications. In this talk, we will
    characterize the diagonalizability of the RSK linear operator in terms of
    Dynkin diagrams and present several results on its eigenvalues, trace, and
    determinant. Based on joint work with Alexander Yong, arXiv:2410.23009.

    Double orthodontia formulas and Lascoux positivity

    Motivated by our search for a representation theoretic avatar for double
    Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak G_w(\mathbf x; \mathbf y)$, we give a
    new formula for $\mathfrak G_w(\mathbf x;\mathbf y)$ based on Magyar's

    result: Writing $\mathfrak S_w(\mathbf x;\mathbf y)$ for a vexillary double
    Schubert polynomial, the polynomial $x_1^n\dots x_n^n \mathfrak
    S_w(x_n^{-1},\dots, x_1^{-1}; 1,\dots,1)$ is a graded nonnegative sum of

    Caractérisation du poset hypergraphique à partir des sources d'orientations

  abstract: >
    Pour un hypergraphe $\mathbb{H}$ sur $[n]$, le poset hypergraphique
    $P_{\mathbb{H}}$  est défini comme la fermeture transitive du 1-squelette
    orienté du polytope hypergraphique $\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}$, qui est la somme
    de Minkowski des simplices standards $\Delta_H$  associés à chaque
    hyperarête $H\in \mathbb{H}$. En 2019, C. Benedetti, N. Bergeron et J.
    Machacek ont établi une correspondance entre cette fermeture transitive et
    le graphe de flips des orientations acycliques de $\mathbb{H}$. En
    considérant une orientation de $\mathbb{H}$ comme une application $A$ de
    $\mathbb{H}$ vers $[n]$, les sources des orientations acycliques sont
    définies par les valeurs $A(H)$ pour chaque hyperarête $H \in \mathbb{H}$.
    Récemment, N. Bergeron et V. Pilaud ont proposé une caractérisation de
    $P_{\mathbb{H}}$ basée sur les sources des orientations acycliques pour les

    A charge monomial basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring
  date: 2025-01-31
  abstract: >
    The two well-known monomial bases of the (classical) coinvariant ring, the
    Artin basis and the descent basis, are indexed by permutations and
    correspond to the statistics inv and maj respectively. Both bases give
    combinatorial explanations for the Hilbert series of the coinvariant ring,
    which is $[n]_q!$. 

    We construct a basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring $R_\mu$, a quotient of the
    coinvariant ring, using the catabolizability type of standard Young tableaux
    and the charge statistic. This basis is  a subset of the descent basis and
    is compatible with the Hilbert series of $R_\mu$ in the same manner.  Our
    construction of the basis provides the first direct connection between the
    combinatorics of the basis with the combinatorial formula for the modified
    Hall-Littlewood polynomials $\widetilde{H}_{\mu}{[X;q]}$, due to Lascoux. We 
    use this description to give an elementary proof of the fact that the graded
    Frobenius character of $R_{\mu}$ is given by $\widetilde{H}_{\mu}{[X;q]}$.

    A combinatorial proof of the (strong) semibrick conjecture for biserial
    algebras
  date: 2025-01-17
  abstract: >
    Let A be a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field k.
    A finite-dimensional (left) A-module is called a brick (or Schur
    representation) if its endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to k. A set S of
    bricks over A is said to be a semibrick if every pair of distinct bricks in
    S are Hom-orthogonal. Bricks (respectively, semibricks) can be viewed as a
    conceptual generalization of simple (respectively, semisimple) modules, and
    they have important applications in representation theory of algebras. In
    2021, Enomoto posed a conjecture, now known as the Semibrick Conjecture: an
    algebra A admits infinitely many non-isomorphic bricks if and only if A
    admits an infinite semibrick-- i.e., there exists an infinite set of
    pairwise Hom-orthogonal bricks. 

    In our recent work (arXiv:2407.20877), we made important progress on a
    series of open conjectures. Specifically, we treated the Semibrick
    Conjecture as well as a conjecture I first proposed in 2019, now referred to
    as the Second Brick-Brauer-Thrall (2nd bBT) Conjecture. While both the 2nd
    bBT and Semibrick conjectures remain open in full generality, we verify them
    for some new families. In fact, we prove that the Semibrick Conjecture
    follows from the 2nd bBT Conjecture. For biserial algebras, we reduce the
    setting to an explicit list of gentle algebras, where we use the
    combinatorics of strings and bands to resolve the conjectures. This talk is
    based on earlier work from my PhD studies and a series of joint work with
    Charles Paquette.

    Une nouvelle description des treillis m-cambriens

    Les treillis cambriens, introduits par N. Reading en 2006, sont une
    généralisation du treillis de Tamari, à tout choix d'élément de Coxeter,
    dans tout groupe de Coxeter fini. Le treillis de Tamari correspond au "type
    A linéaire". Ces ordres partiels admettent plusieurs descriptions, non
    trivialement équivalentes. Celles-ci donnent lieu à une généralisation
    commune, comme définie par C. Stump, H. Thomas et N. Williams. Toutefois,
    aucune de ces descriptions ne fournit de modèle combinatoire pratique.

    Dans un travail en cours avec Wenjie Fang et Corentin Henriet, nous
    proposons une nouvelle définition équivalente des treillis m-cambriens. Nous
    donnons un critère de comparaison simple et effectif sur des objets simples
    appelés m-partitions non croisées. Cette définition est obtenue en montrant
    qu'il existe une unique chaîne c-croissante entre n'importe quelle paire
    d'éléments comparables, et cette dernière est calculée par un algorithme
    glouton. Ce faisant, nous introduisons un (presque) ordre partiel
    intéressant sur les intervalles d'un treillis cambriens, qui est nouveau,
    même pour le cas du treillis de Tamari.

    Standard Crystals for symmetric Grothendieck Polynomials
  date: 2024-12-13
  abstract: >
    Schur polynomials form a fundamental basis for symmetric polynomials.
    Motivated by geometry and representation theory, researchers have expanded
    various polynomials into the Schur basis positively, including (i) skew
    Schur polynomials, (ii) products of Schur polynomials, and (iii) Stanley
    symmetric polynomials. Standard crystals provide an elegant framework that
    effectively demonstrates these Schur expansions. Symmetric Grothendieck
    polynomials are non-homogeneous analogues of Schur polynomials, arising from
    the K-theory of flag varieties. Analogous expansions into symmetric
    Grothendieck polynomials have garnered significant attention over the past
    decades: Buch established the K-theoretic analogues of (i) and (ii), while
    Buch, Kresch, Shimozono, Tamvakis, and Yong resolved (iii). In this talk, we
    present an analogue of standard crystal theory, introducing a powerful new
    tool for establishing symmetric Grothendieck positivity. This framework not
    only recovers the three K-theoretic expansions mentioned above but also
    sheds light on related problems, including a conjecture of Ikeda and Naruse.
    This work is based on ongoing joint work with Eric Marberg and Kam Hung
    Tong.

    Comparing two biperfect bases using category O
  date: 2024-12-06
  abstract: >
    The apparently elementary question of writing down perfect bases for the
    finite dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple Lie algebras is
    a problem which finds its source in surprisingly involved mathematical
    tools. Two such sources are a version of the geometric Satake equivalence
    (giving rise to the so-called Mirkovic-Vilonen bases) and a categorification
    of $U_q^{-}$ using KLR algebras (giving rise to the so-called dual canonical
    bases). It has been shown that those two families of bases do not coincide,
    raising the question of understanding the change of basis matrix. Building
    upon the results of Kamnitzer-Tingley-Webster-Weekes-Yacobi, we show how one
    can use category O for truncated shifted Yangians to better understand the
    discrepancies between the bases. This is joint work with Joel Kamnitzer.

    The quasisymmetric flag variety and equivariant forest polynomials
  date: 2024-11-22
  abstract: >
    Schubert calculus transforms the intersection theory of the flag variety
    GL_n/B into a multiplication problem for combinatorial polynomials, while
    double Schubert calculus extends this to a torus-equivariant setting. Two
    essential components underlie these approaches: (1) a surjective
    homomorphism from an infinite polynomial ring F[x1, x2, …] to the
    (torus-equivariant) cohomology ring of GL_n/B, and (2) the existence of
    Schubert polynomials, a basis of F[x1, x2, …] that interacts naturally with
    the surjection from (1). This talk will describe a subvariety of GL_n/B that
    exhibits a surprisingly tight analogue of (1) and (2) with respect to a
    known basis of polynomials over Z and generalize this basis to the
    equivariant setting. I will show how these new objects can be analyzed
    using tools from algebraic combinatorics, such as noncrossing partitions and
    quasisymmetric polynomials, and speculate about how this can deepen our
    understanding of equivariant Schubert calculus. This is ongoing work with
    Nantel Bergeron, Philippe Nadeau, Hunter Spink, and Vasu Tewari.

    Random Combinatorial Billiards

    Combinatorial billiards is a new topic that concerns rigid and discretized

    will introduce a random combinatorial billiard trajectory depending on some
    fixed probability p; when p tends to 0, it essentially recovers Thomas Lam's
    reduced random walk. This random billiard trajectory can also be interpreted
    as a random growth process on core partitions. The analysis of the random
    billiard trajectory relies on new finite Markov chains called stoned
    exclusion processes, which are variants of certain interacting particle
    systems. These processes have remarkable stationary distributions determined
    by well-studied polynomials such as ASEP polynomials, inhomogeneous TASEP
    polynomials, and open boundary ASEP polynomials; in many cases, it was
    previously not known how to construct Markov chains with these stationary
    distributions.

    Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra

    The eigenvalues of a Markov chain determine its mixing time. In this talk, I
    will describe a Markov chain on the symmetric group called random-to-random

    year conjecture.

    In recent work with Ilani Axelrod-Freed, Judy Chiang, Patricia Commins and

    the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and prove combinatorial expressions for
    its eigenvalues as a polynomial in q with non-negative integer coefficients.
    Our methods simplify the existing proof for q=1 by drawing novel connections

    Beyond weak order on the affine symmetric group
  date: 2024-10-04
  abstract: >
    We will generalize many facts about the weak order on a finite Coxeter group
    to the _extended weak order_ on an affine Weyl group. Whereas the weak order
    is the poset of regions in the Coxeter arrangement, the extended weak order
    is the poset of _quasiregions_.  Quasiregions include regions, but for
    infinite Coxeter group they also include more exotic objects (equivalent to
    _biclosed sets_ of positive roots). 
    
    For instance, in type $\widetilde{A}$, quasiregions are equivalent to
    translation-invariant total orderings of the integers (TITOs). In type
    $\widetilde{A}$, the extended weak order is a lattice, while the weak order
    is not. We show that, in this case, the extended weak order is a lattice
    quotient of the lattice of torsion classes for a type $\widetilde{A}$
    preprojective algebra. We also introduce the affine Tamari lattice, which is
    the poset of $312$-avoiding TITOs, and show how it describes a cluster
    algebra for the oriented cycle quiver.

    The Temperley—Lieb algebra is a classical mathematical object studied in
    algebra, combinatorics, statistical mechanics and mathematical physics,

    For any Coxeter system, it is possible to define the so-called generalized
    Temperley—Lieb algebras as quotients of the associated Hecke algebras.
    Moreover, beginning with the work of Kauffman and Penrose, it was shown
    that most Temperley—Lieb algebras can be realized as diagram algebras,
    which are associative algebras with a basis given by certain diagrams on
    the plane.

    In this talk, I will introduce a diagrammatic representation for the

    Quivers and their mutations play a fundamental role in the theory of cluster

    additional structure of a cyclic ordering on the set of vertices of a quiver.
    This leads to new powerful invariants of quiver mutation. These invariants
    can be used to show that various quivers are not mutation acyclic, i.e., they
